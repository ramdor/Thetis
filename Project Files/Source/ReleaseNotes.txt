# !! CW Warning !!

If you use CW and you have different RX and TX antenna ports configured, there is a high potential for full RF power to be present briefly on the RX port. This may lead to damage of any sensitive equipment attached to the RX port such as active antennas and the like. This situation can occur if you utilise the CWX form, serial keying/PTT, and standard hardware keys plugged into the radio. This issue is currently under investigation and has existed in Thetis for an extended period (years and years). If you are interested in following the progress, you can read more about it on [GitHub here](https://github.com/ramdor/Thetis/issues/228).

**Note: You can revisit these release notes by clicking the button in the setup form within the General -> H/W Select tab.**

- compare version in TX profile importing fixed
- .net framework moved to 4.8.1
- skin server implementation
- skin image handles released correctly after the images have been loaded. Known issue with Image.FromFile
- FM tx/rx AF filters in DSP FM tab

	- RX EQ data and enabled state
	- WASAPI exclusive states
- cfc display changes and should correctly show again
- mic phase reversal in DSP->CFC->PhaseRot area. Phase rot does not need to be enabled for mic phase to be used
- updates to UI controls, positions and colours by DH1KLM
- changes to serial to hopefully prevent rare freeze situation
- RadioDSP is now destroyed down on exit to ensure clean shutdown
- mon should now return correctly when using cwu and changing to other modes

- audio device dropdowns resized in setup
- release notes shown on DB upgrade and button to show again from Setup->General->H/W Select
- the force db upgrade by holding CTRL when Thetis is launched now has additional yes/no prompt to prevent accidental upgrading
- rear speaker amp can now be disabled with G2 and G2_1k, setting in Setup->Audio->Options
- system CPU usage should better match taskmanager. Thetis process only usage is still a mystery
